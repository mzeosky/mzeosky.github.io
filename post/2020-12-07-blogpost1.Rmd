However, more recently I have been learning how to tie in Python as well in order to complement both languages. Something we have recently been learning about is regular expressions and how to use them to search through large amounts of data, which can be seen below.

```{python}

Mr. Skilling:  Your P number is P00500599.  For your convenience, you can also go to http://isc.enron.com/site/ under"

URLS=re.findall(r'http://[\'"]?[^\>" "]+',string4)
re.findall(r'http://[\'"]?[^\>" "]+',string4)
```
First, it recieves a large amount of text, and traversese the entirety of it while printing the determined website urls. This list of URLs is saved into a variable called URLS.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
nchar(py$URLS, type ="chars")
```

Then using reticulate this python variable can be accessed in R, where the number of characters in each URL are then printed.
